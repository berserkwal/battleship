# BattleShip (game)

This is my attempt at making BattleShip game as part of my learning journey at The Odin Project.

## Technology used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Features included

- Drag and drop feature to place blocks
- Can start a randomized game without placing blocks
- CPU moves are random but when an attack is a hit, it hits nearby block like any human would (needs work as it will randomize the attack once it reaches a dead-end)

## Live-demo
